A simple command-line interface (CLI) application to manage and track tasks using a JSON file as a storage backend.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Update task descriptions
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as in-progress or done
- List all tasks or filter by status (todo, in-progress, done)

## Installation

```sh
cd task-cli
```

## Usage

### Adding a Task
```sh
node task-cli.js add "Buy groceries"
```
**Output:** `Task added successfully (ID: 1)`

### Updating a Task

```
**Output:** `Task updated successfully (ID: 1)`

### Deleting a Task
```sh

```
**Output:** `Task (ID: 1) deleted successfully`

### Marking a Task as In-Progress

## File Storage
Tasks are stored in a `tasks.json` file, automatically created in the working directory.

## Error Handling
- Invalid command inputs are handled with appropriate error messages.
- Prevents invalid IDs and incorrect arguments.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for due dates and priorities.
- Implement a UI for better visualization.
- Add task persistence across multiple users.

Enjoy tracking your tasks efficiently! ðŸš€
